# Bookia (Summary)

A Flutter book store app. Current milestone focuses on authentication.

## Implemented so far
- Login
- Register
- Forgot password (request code)
- Reset password (using verification code)

## Notes
- UI uses a custom theme, SVG assets, and reusable components.
- Networking is wired to a REST API for the auth flows.

## Next steps (planned)
- Browse books, details, cart, and checkout flows
- Persisted auth/session handling
- Error handling and empty/loading states across screens
